# MyMvcApp

MyMvcApp is an ASP.NET Core MVC application. This project is structured to follow the standard conventions of an ASP.NET Core MVC application, with folders for controllers, models, views, and other supporting files.

## Project Structure

Below is a detailed explanation of the project structure:

### Root Files
- **`appsettings.json`**: The default configuration file for the application. Contains settings such as connection strings, logging configurations, and other application-specific settings.
- **`appsettings.Development.json`**: Configuration file specific to the Development environment. Overrides settings in `appsettings.json` when the application is run in the Development environment.
- **`deploy.json`**: Contains deployment-specific configurations.
- **`deploy.parameters.json`**: Parameters for deployment, typically used with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates.
- **`MyMvcApp.csproj`**: The project file for the application. Defines dependencies, build configurations, and other project settings.
- **`MyMvcApp.sln`**: The solution file for the project. Used to manage the project in Visual Studio.
- **`Program.cs`**: The entry point of the application. Configures and starts the web host.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing documentation for the project.

### Directories

#### `.github/`
- **`workflows/`**: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD pipelines.

#### `.vscode/`
- **`launch.json`**: Configuration for debugging the application in Visual Studio Code.
- **`tasks.json`**: Configuration for build and task automation in Visual Studio Code.

#### `bin/`
- **`Debug/`**: Contains compiled binaries and other build artifacts for the Debug configuration.

#### `Controllers/`
- **`UserController.cs`**: Contains the logic for handling user-related HTTP requests. This is part of the MVC pattern's "Controller" layer.

#### `Models/`
- **`ErrorViewModel.cs`**: Represents the model for error handling and displaying error information in views.
- **`User.cs`**: Represents the user model, typically used for user-related data and business logic.

#### `obj/`
- Contains intermediate build files and project-related metadata generated during the build process. Key files include:
  - **`MyMvcApp.csproj.nuget.dgspec.json`**: NuGet dependency graph specification.
  - **`MyMvcApp.csproj.nuget.g.props`**: Auto-generated MSBuild properties for NuGet.
  - **`MyMvcApp.csproj.nuget.g.targets`**: Auto-generated MSBuild targets for NuGet.
  - **`project.assets.json`**: Contains resolved dependencies for the project.
  - **`project.nuget.cache`**: Cache file for NuGet dependencies.

#### `Properties/`
- **`launchSettings.json`**: Contains settings for launching the application, such as environment variables and profiles for different hosting environments.

#### `Views/`
- **`_ViewImports.cshtml`**: Contains directives (e.g., `@using`, `@addTagHelper`) that are shared across all views.
- Other `.cshtml` files (not listed) represent the views for the application, which are part of the MVC pattern's "View" layer.
